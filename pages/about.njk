            <h3>Programming education</h3>
            <p>I initially started programming using R during my PhD, and later became acquainted with SQL and databases through the <a href="https://gb.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics" target="_blank">Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate</a>. Following that, I successfully completed freeCodeCamp's <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/" target="_blank">Scientific Computing with Python</a> and <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x"  target="_blank">Harvard's CS50x course</a> 'Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming'. Most recently, I completed freeCodeCamp's <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank"> Responsive Web Design </a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/" target="_blank">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures</a> certifications.</p>
            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>I have gained hands-on experience in multiple languages through completing various programming assignments and projects designed to test my ability to solve-real world problems. These programming languages include C, R, SQL, Python, and JavaScript alongside markup languages like HTML and CSS. Moreover, I have gained further experience by developing my own personal projects which you can browse <a href="/">here</a>.</p>
            <h3>Current plans</h3>
            <p>Since grasping key programming fundamentals, I have focused on project-based learning. By creating my own programs and websites, I have gained a better understanding of the programming concepts I already know and their practical application. Furthermore, as I tackle challenges that arise during projects and work on implementing my ideas, I naturally encounter and learn new programming concepts, skills, and tools.</p>
            <p>As a result, my current plan is to continue developing new web development projects while challenging myself to write better code than before, hone my current skills, and add new tools to my skill set with each project.</p>
            <p>My main goal is to secure a developer job. I recognize that working within a team alongside more experienced and professional programmers is the logical next step in my programming journey and the best way to improve. Presently, I am focusing on frontend development and concentrating on improving my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. After building a firm foundation in those core frontend web technologies I plan to delve into a framework such as React, Svelte, or Vue.</p>

            <h3>Why Program?</h3>
            <p>As a PhD graduate in an unrelated field, I chose to become a programmer and web developer. If youâ€™re wondering why then please read on.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>It is rewarding.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>What you can do with a computer, a programming language, and lines of code is impressive. How it works under-the-hood is fascinating. Creating a program or website that helps yourself or others is, simply put, rewarding.</p>
            <ol start="2">
                <li>The process is captivating and satisfying.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Programming can be frustrating; however, its process is equally captivating and satisfying. It invites creativity as one applies programming concepts from your toolkit in differing ways to solve problems and implement ideas. Furthermore, improving at this process adds another layer of satisfaction.</p>
            <ol start="3">
                <li>My academic experience transfers over.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Through completing my PhD I became an expert researcher, acquired a strong drive to succeed, cultivated discipline, and honed my ability to persevere through difficult problems until finding a solution. These skills and traits are all incredibly useful and relevant for learning programming.</p>
